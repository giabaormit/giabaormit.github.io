<!-- 
 I designed this memory game as an educational and engaging experience that revolves around film production
objects with interactive informative content. Inspired by Match the Memory, Memozor, and Memory Matching
I want to improve the core concept with more features and redefine the style. By adding additional fun 
facts when you successfully match the cards, it turns this game from a normal visual memory game to a 
learning opportunity to explore more about the world of filmmaking equipment and techniques. Minimalistic
was chosen to focus on usability, visual clarity, and responsive UI/UX.  Moreover, I also added the time counter, 
move counter, reset button, hint button, light/dark mode drop-down menu selector, and a final celebration
ending scene to enhance the user experience and add a nice touch when you finish the game. The inclusion of
time and move counts forces people in a hurry to make the ending more rewarding. The reset and hint button are
added to make the game easier and provide extra help.  Light and dark themes are added with good contrast ratios to 
maintain readability and reduce eye strain in different environments. I reckon the game can be updated due to the 
fact that it is built on normal javascript with simple code with mostly text. The completed matches list also adds 
another layer of progression and balances the design of the website to make the learning and engagement more 
interesting. The layout is created in a harmonious way to fit the purpose of using both laptops and phones.
The potential update for the website could potentially be adding audio response feedback, expanding additional filmmaking concept, or making different game modes like: easy, hard, and medium with 
different layouts of the board. Overall, this project demonstrates how a simple memory game format can be transformed 
into a tool for both entertainment and education.
